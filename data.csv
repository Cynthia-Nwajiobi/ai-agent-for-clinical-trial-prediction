ISRCTN68069634,"The effects of a 2-week whole-body electromyostimulation in cancer patients",2019,"Various studies show that regular physical activity is an efficient approach to increase medical therapy tolerance and may even improve its effectiveness in cancer patients. However, it is not always possible for patients to perform strenuous and time-consuming exercise programs. For that reason, whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) may be an interesting alternative form of exercise for cancer patients. In contrast to voluntary muscle contraction caused by small electrical impulses from the central nervous system, WB-EMS generates muscle contraction by an external EMS device. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to examine whether 2 weeks of WB-EMS exercise are feasible and effective in cancer patients during medical treatment.",Cancer,Interventional,Device,Phase 1/Phase 2,13,Adherance to training intervention,Met,"The pilot-study has shown that WB-EMS is possible and feasible in oncological patients. Two-weeks of WB-EMS application showed positive effects in subjectively perceived physical functionality and quality of life in cancer patients, suggesting the potential of this exercise method even in short-term time-periods. The skeletal muscle mass did not change. We reason that WB-EMS could be of great value as training method in patients’ collectives who may not be able to perform conventional strength training protocols due to medical limitation (for instance: bone-metastasis), time-reasons or already prevalent muscle atrophy or cachexia. These patient collectives would be interesting to focus in future research trials including WB-EMS exercise. Furthermore, the observed effects of this 2-week intervention may suggest WB-EMS as promising approach for prehabilitative exercise interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN68069634

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a concentrate of plasma rich in platelets derived from whole blood, centrifuged to remove red blood cells. It has a higher concentration of growth factors than whole blood and is widely used in regenerative medicine to encourage the healing of bone and soft tissues. The use of PRP may also reduce pain in the postoperative period. This study aims to evaluate the impact of PRP application during surgical treatment on wound healing and pain intensity feeling in patients with gynecological cancers (ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer).",Gynaecological cancer,Interventional,Biological/Vaccine,Phase 2/Phase 3,46,Wound healing and pain relief,Met,"The presented study demonstrated that PRP application during abdominal closure in patients with gynaecological malignancies undergoing laparotomy improves wound healing and also reduces pain and the use of analgesics in the early postoperative period. Taking into consideration that cancer patients are at high risk of wound complications that may have detrimental effects for further treatment, i.a. causing a need to postpone adjuvant treatment, such as chemo- or radiotherapy, the use of PRP may be a promising and completely safe method for enhanced recovery in this group of women.",https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN17395989

A reduced psoas muscle mass would increase the risk of tumor recurrence, while an increased subcutaneous fat volume decreased it. VAT, on the other hand, was not associated with tumor recurrence after surgery. Our newly developed scoring system, which incorporated patient factor skeletal muscle and body fat mass could estimate the risk of early recurrence after liver resection. In addition, in patients with low PMI or high SAT index, free fatty acid β-oxidation was enhanced to provide additional energy supply. Further studies are warranted to unravel the mechanistic relationships and therapeutic potentials between disturbed body composition and the outcome of HCC.",https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN12021668

The 5-year survival rate for individuals with breast-confined disease ranges from 90 to 99%, but it falls to 85% for those with regional lymph node metastases. Therefore, a correct evaluation of axillary lymph node status is important for staging breast cancer and choosing the best treatment. Sonography can detect metastatic lymph nodes with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity, while its routine use in the preoperative assessment of axillary lymph nodes remains controversial. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pretreatment axillary sonography in a clinical setting in Iraq and to determine whether a sonographic evaluation of the axilla as a tool for the regional staging of breast cancer should be routinely performed in all cases.",Breast cancer,Observational cohort study,Diagnostic,Phase 2/Phase 3,180,Detection metastatic lymph nodes through sonography ,Met,"The sonographic assessment of the axilla in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients was satisfactory, with a high accuracy rate (92. 4%).Therefore, we encourage the use of this simple method of imaging in this regard, as it is relatively cheap and affordable compared to other imaging methods.

Since AML treatment cannot be delayed, clinicians face a dilemma: standard intensive chemotherapy offers the best chance of a cure but causes severe immunosuppression and requires long hospital stays, increasing the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19. Compounded by the fact that AML patients are already vulnerable to other deadly infections, there is currently no data to guide the management of AML patients who contract the virus. Therefore, a study is proposed to collect data on the outcomes, infection rates, and severity in AML patients with COVID-19 to establish best practices and update treatment recommendations during the pandemic era.","Acute myeloid leukaemia, COVID-19",Observational cohort study,Other,Phase 2/Phase 3,321,To assess incidence of COVID-19 infection during treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML),Unknown,Unknown,https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16865769
ISRCTN69229101,Development of a tool for effective comparisons of breast cancer survival between hospitals,2022,"Breast cancer prognosis depends on several factors including how biologically aggressive the breast cancer is as well as other patient-related factors (for example other diseases).
Comparing survival rates for patients with breast cancer between Swedish hospitals does not take into consideration that different hospitals might have underlying differences in their patient populations that impact the chance of survival. It is therefore hard to interpret whether the hospital with the highest survival has the best breast cancer care or if that hospital happens to have the patients with the best prerequsites to survive their diagnosis.
This study aims to create a tool for the patient, healthcare and policymakers for continuous follow-up of breast cancer care nationally and in the long-term internationally. This enables more transparent and effective comparisons of breast cancer survival between Swedish hospitals.

It is the commonest adult leukaemia, with 3,800 people diagnosed each year in the UK. It is more common in people aged over 60 years. Currently some 31,900 people have CLL in the UK.
CLL develops slowly and there is no cure. People with CLL have a weakened immune system and are susceptible to infections. These infections can be severe and life-threatening. New drugs called Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have transformed the outlook for CLL patients, however they stop the immune response to vaccination. They need to be taken daily and continuously. They are sometimes paused if a patient needs an operation. In the UK, they are used at all stages of treatment. The IMPROVE study aims to find out:

ISRCTN82505455,Activity as medicine in oncology for head and neck,2024,"We aim to increase head and neck cancer (HaNC) patients’ engagement in physical exercise. There are many proven benefits of exercise following cancer treatment, aiding recovery, reducing risk of cancer returning, improving physical and psychological well-being and quality of life (QOL). However, the vast majority of HaNC patients have low levels of physical activity both pre- and post-treatment. There are multiple reasons for this; HaNC treatment is often aggressive with severe side-effects e.g. profoundly dry mouth, breathing through a hole in the neck, shoulder dysfunction, poor swallowing making it difficult to exercise; apprehension about participating in groups due to altered facial appearance; many are from low socio-economic areas, with high risk smoking and alcohol behaviours and other health problems; HaNC services are regional, requiring long journeys to access specialist support. Our survey of 400 HaNC patients found a desire to participate in an exercise programme, if tailored to individual needs and preferences.

ISRCTN58338025,A study to identify increased production of aldosterone by the adrenal gland using PET/CT scanning techniques,2024,"Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) is a hormonal disorder that causes high blood pressure, often due to a non-cancerous tumor overproducing the hormone aldosterone. Current methods for diagnosing this tumor are invasive and often inconclusive. To improve diagnosis, researchers have developed a new, radioactively labeled molecule that targets aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), the main enzyme controlling aldosterone secretion. After successful animal trials, the goal is to test this molecule as a tracer in human patients using PET/CT scans. The study aims to measure the enzyme's levels in the body and validate this new imaging technique against existing methods, potentially offering a more reliable and less invasive diagnostic tool.",Aldosterone-producing adenoma,Interventional,Procedure/Surgery,Phase 1,17,Efficacy of the procedure,Met,"The scan with the [18F]AldoView dye was found to be safe, with no side effects reported. The specific adrenal glands that were overproducing aldosterone were clearly identified, and the optimal time for the scan was determined to be approximately 35–45 minutes after the dye was administered. The scan's results were shown to closely match those of adrenal vein sampling (AVS), a test already in use, but the new scan was noted to be less invasive, much quicker, and potentially easier to implement. The accuracy of the PET/CT scan was further confirmed by the alignment of its results with laboratory tests performed on the removed adrenal glands. With this new method, the problematic adrenal gland could be identified quickly and safely, potentially allowing more patients to be treated with the correct surgery and for their reliance on blood pressure medication to be reduced. It is also suggested that the scan has the potential to be a more comfortable and accessible diagnostic test.",https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN58338025

ISRCTN10972467,Outcomes of two-stage liver resection in the treatment of a rare type of primary liver cancer,2022,"Different approaches have been introduced for the treatment of patients with liver cancer. However, in some cases, surgical treatment is considered the best and only option to eliminate the disease and guarantee the patients a better therapeutic outcome. Cholangiocarcinoma is a liver cancer originating from biliary structures which can only be treated efficiently by liver surgery. Liver surgery is a major surgery with a wide range of risks, which might result in different complications and even death. Particularly in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, a large volume of the liver is removed during surgery to prevent the recurrence of the disease. This can lead to liver dysfunction and even more dangerous complications. Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a new technique for liver surgery which involves two stages of surgery and is believed to prevent hazardous complications after high-volume liver resection due to its stepwise process that provides the liver enough time for recovery. However, the outcomes of ALPPS in the treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma are not well-understood. This study evaluates the impact of ALPPS in the treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma.",Cholangiocarcinoma,Interventional,Procedure/Surgery,Phase 1/Phase 2,30,"Postoperative major morbidity, 90-day mortality, One- and three-year disease-free and overall survival rates",NA,"The ALPPS procedure was modified by externalizing the biliary flow, delaying biliary reconstruction to the second stage, and employing interstage antibiotic therapy. Our experience of extended liver resection strongly suggests that using the modified ALPPS procedure in patients with cholangiocarcinoma with insufficient RLV produces better outcomes, particularly in patients with PHCC. The key to this improvement was minimizing the first stage of the operation to reduce patient risk during the second stage. However, future studies are needed to define benchmarks for the ALPPS procedure among cholangiocarcinoma patients.",https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10972467

There is currently no screening programme for womb cancer, and clinical assessment is led by the symptom of abnormal vaginal bleeding, which is considered a red flag. Identifying women with womb cancer with current approaches is difficult. Transvaginal ultrasound, the gold standard clinical approach, results in many women undergoing invasive confirmatory diagnostics in order to detect each case of womb cancer.
The novel WID™-qEC test, which is a molecular test based on cervical smear specimens, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific.
