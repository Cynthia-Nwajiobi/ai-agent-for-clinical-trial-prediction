  "justification": "The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a standard and effective regimen for locally advanced cervical cancer. This treatment is well-documented to produce significant tumor shrinkage, leading to high response rates. A retrospective study is designed to analyze past outcomes, and given the established efficacy of this regimen, it is highly probable that the study will report a positive tumor response rate, thus meeting its primary endpoint.",
  "flag": "Green Flag",
  "rationale": "High confidence (90%) due to the retrospective nature of the study on a standard-of-care, effective chemotherapy regimen. The primary endpoint, tumor response rate, is an expected and consistently observed outcome for carboplatin-paclitaxel in this setting.",
